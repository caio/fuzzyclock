INTRODUCTION
============

fuzzyclock is a simple program written in C to output the current time
in a "fuzzy format", i.e.: instead of outputting 4:17, it will write
out "quarter past four".

This program was written as an exercise for learning about the Check
testing framework and refreshing my (rather basic) autotools knowledge.


USAGE
=====

In the command line:

    fuzzyclock

You can also use the libfuzzyclock.a library in your software. Check
src/fuzzyclock.h for the exported functions.
